# scrape-wikipedia-current-events
A script to get news headlines from Wikipedia's current events portal from specific start and end dates, plus a notebook to analyze the collected data and another notebook to predict year and subject of various headlines.

Please see the general info for this project on the [Projects page](https://justinslud.github.io/projects.html##wikipedia-current-news-analysis)
 
I split this project into 3 parts:

1. [Collecting the data](https://github.com/justinslud/scrape-wikipedia-current-events/blob/main/wiki_scrape_db.py)
2. [Exploring and understanding the data](https://github.com/justinslud/scrape-wikipedia-current-events/blob/main/explore_headlines.ipynb)
3. Machine learning tasks (in progress)
